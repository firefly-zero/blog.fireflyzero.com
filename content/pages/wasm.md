## Browser: the most complex program

Every second, your computer runs thousands of programs. There are some obvious ones, like the text editor or file explorer, and more low-level, behind the scenes programs, like drivers that make work devices, like keyboard or wifi.

But the most complex program of all is a web browser. Each page you open runs dozens if not hunderds of scripts often written by different companies and people. And each of these scripts can have acces to lots of things. The Mozila Developer Network reference [lists 136 categories](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) of APIs available to such scripts. Some of the things a website can do:

* Play audio
* Play video
* Send network requests
* Access Bluetooth
* Access camera and microphone
* Access files on your computer
* Get your battery status

And with great power comes great responsibility...

## Viruses are everywhere

One of the oldest computer viruses we know about is [Morris worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm). Internet wasn't even called internet at the time, we had [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) instead. Only 6k devices were infected but since at only about 60k devices were connected to ARPANET, that meant 10% of all possible devices.

Another interesting virus is [Mydoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mydoom). It was the fastest spreading computer virus in history and it still holds the record. Distributed through email, it sends itself to all email addresses in the victim's inbox, which resulted in at least 500k computers infected worldwide.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. [There are some statistics](https://dataprot.net/statistics/malware-statistics/):

* 560,000 new pieces of malware are detected every day.
* There are now more than 1 billion malware programs out there.
* Every minute, four companies fall victim to ransomware attacks.
* 7% of websites are infected.
* 47% of computers in China are infected.

## You have a lot to lose

...

* **Corporate secrets**. More than â‚¬10 billion was paid in ransoms during 2019. 45% of organizations affected by ransomware attacks chose to pay the ransom, and half of them still lost their data.
* **Money**.
* **Personal files**.
* **Privacy**.
* **Resources**.

## Nobody expects a Spanish inquisition

...

* Running a file.
* Downloading a file.
* Opening an email.
* Opening a website.
* Adding a dependency.
* Accepting a contribution.
* Doing a test assignment.
